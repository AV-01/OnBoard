# PCB Business Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
It's a PCB card designed using the hack club tutorial. It will make me look more cool and hacky :)
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
4$ normally, but 2$ with the special offer
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
